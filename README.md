## Lessons Learned

I'd been running behind on homeworks due to being overwhelmed by new concepts and loss of time transitioning into new role at my work. While collaborating with fellow cohorts in our last major project, everything started to click and this was good refresher to go back and work on these homeworks I had missed.
